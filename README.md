# Transactions and ACID Properties

This repository focuses on the concept of transactions in database systems and the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties that ensure the reliability and integrity of these transactions. This guide provides an overview of transactions, the significance of each ACID property, and how they are implemented in practice.

### Basic SQL Syntax for Transactions
To start, commit, or rollback transactions, SQL provides the following commands:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- SQL operations
COMMIT; -- To save changes
ROLLBACK; -- To undo changes if needed
```sql
## Overview
In relational database management, transactions play a crucial role in managing and preserving data integrity. Each transaction is a sequence of one or more operations, treated as a single unit of work. To guarantee reliable transaction processing, databases adhere to the ACID properties, ensuring predictable and safe results.

## Transactions
A **transaction** is a logical unit of work that must be completed in its entirety or not at all. Transactions may involve operations like creating, updating, or deleting data in a database. If any part of a transaction fails, the whole transaction fails, ensuring that the database remains in a consistent state.

## ACID Properties

ACID properties define the standards for transactions to ensure data integrity and fault tolerance. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each property:

### Atomicity
- **Definition**: Atomicity guarantees that each transaction is "all or nothing." If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged.
- **Example**: In a banking transaction, both the debit from one account and the credit to another must occur. If either fails, neither should proceed.

### Consistency
- **Definition**: Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all predefined rules and constraints.
- **Example**: If a database constraint requires an account balance to be positive, a transaction that results in a negative balance will be rejected.

### Isolation
- **Definition**: Isolation ensures that transactions are executed as if they are isolated from each other, preventing unintended interference and maintaining data accuracy in concurrent processing.
- **Example**: If two users attempt to update the same account balance at the same time, isolation prevents one transaction from affecting the other until it is complete.

### Durability
- **Definition**: Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanently recorded, even in the event of a system failure.
- **Example**: After transferring money from one account to another, the update remains even if the system crashes afterward.

## Implementation
The repository contains scripts and examples demonstrating how transactions and ACID properties are implemented in various database management systems (DBMS). Each example illustrates how the properties work to preserve data integrity.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transactions-acid-properties.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository:
